    * Without the symbols: [PDF](Vector Card template.pdf) or [Visio](Vector Card template.vsd)
    * One includes little symbols on them
    * The other doesn't (You can add the pictures using stickers)

2. Make any changes, like adding color patters (Optional)
3. Print.  If you're like me, the printer doesn't like card stock  
4. Cut out
