# Bingo and mini-Bingo

Bingo and mini-Bingo were concepts for possible future robots.
One concept was a large body that could be used in a building security role.
On the other end was a smaller -- soda can sized -- bot that would suitable
for running around the floors in homes.

## Mock ups of the idea, feel and inspiration

An exploration of the character design:

Taking inspiration in its spirit and shape from dogs and other animals:

From Matthew Mallet:

> "miniBINGO is a black iPhone 7 with polymer clay modeled over the top of a
> thin clear plastic lining. When miniBINGO is placed on a flat surface, it
> leans against a large piece of clay as a stand attached to what looks like an
> hourglass conveyer roller. The clay wraps around the front of the iPhone in a
> set of 3 diagonal partitions from top corner towards the bottom corner.  Each
> of these pieces of clay have cuts giving it a sharper modern look.  When he
> is plugged in on normal boot he displays the name of the device as miniBINGO."

> "Fun fact: miniBINGO was never meant to be a finished robot.  It was a way to
> show character design from idea to working prototype."

## Some industrial design sketchs
Below are some exploratory ideas.  Note: these are not what the robot would
have looked like; they were trying out ideas for people to respond to and
help iteratively craft the look.

From Harald Belker's site:

> The idea of having a self-navigating and self-balancing robot in the house was going to be the evolution to the current household smart speaker systems. In our mind it could only succeed if it moves around in a smooth and natural looking way.

> A self-balancing robot would address these issues, but it also created a long list of mechanical issues that come with it.

> A larger office version would have three wheels but still imitate motion by tilting forward. This device would be the ideal office helper / mule. ([Hans Belker](https://www.haraldbelker.com/consumer-products/anki-drive/))
