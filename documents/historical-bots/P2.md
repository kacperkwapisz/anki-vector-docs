# P2
 
P2 was the second batch of prototype Vectors.

The head hardware is actually mostly final, and can be upgraded, though the body is quite weird. It is not known if the body can be upgraded.

The plastics look pretty cool.

All of these seem to have USB ports, and have an Android build that needs some help turning on. You need to run `adb reboot bootloader` then `fastboot continue`
