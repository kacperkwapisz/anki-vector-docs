# Vector Character Design

Adapted from Cozmo's "Brief" (see the [Cozmo design guide](Cozmo design guide.md) ):

<div width="100%" height="900em" style="font-family:Avenir,Arial;font-size:11pt;font-weight: 600;background-image: linear-gradient(#F8D400, #FFAB01);color:white">
<div style="max-width:6200pt;line-height: 1.7em; padding:20pt;">
<p style="color:#CF4C00;text-transform:uppercase">The ultimate goal for Cozmo and Vector is to create a real, believable robotic character that feels alive.

</p><p>Something we have seen over and over again in movies, but  never in real life. Cozmo and Vector need to feel alive the same way a pet feels alive, by creating a strong emotional connection with people. Really long term, we want to create a series of characters, with an ecosystem around them and the ability to have the types of stories we only see in movies play out in the real world.

</p><p style="color:#CF4C00;text-transform:uppercase">The top priority, above all else, is highlighting the personality of the character.  Everything else becomes a tool in service of that goal.

</p><p>Cozmo and Vector are the soul of the product, and where the ‘magic’ is.  Everything else in the experience is in service of making the
character feel alive, and emotionally intelligent.  Mini-games, UX, game mechanics/structure, story, etc. should all be thought of as tools for creating context for making Cozmo and Vector feel more alive with a richer personality. The game is a means for driving engagement / exploration of Cozmo and Vector, and their boundaries.  Cozmo and Vector will have a limited ability to understand his world in general, but be extremely smart in specific areas. Our goal is to optimize for his strengths, and avoid his constraints. The goal for any accessories, games, etc. for Cozmo and Vector is to channel players’ attention towards the things that Cozmo and Vector understand really well. These are the best opportunities for us to impress and surprise the user with emotions and depth of character and intelligence in a way that only we can.

</p><p>Think of Cozmo and Vector as your robot pets, with regards to exploring possible interaction, play and responsibilities.  Not in how it looks (no fur and whiskers). He’s smart, he’s emotional, he recognizes you, he has a sense of humor, he wants to interact with you -- these are the types of feelings we want to naturally draw out of users.
