# Typefaces

If you find that you wish to display text on Vector's display, you probably
will have to create a picture with the text pre-rendered or create PNG's for
the glyphs. 
Vector doesn't included a "nice" font internally to display text.
He does include a few of the digits, to display the weather, and fault codes.

The typefaces you can consider are:

* Avenir is your best bet.  It is the font in the Cozmo style guide, and
  included in the Cozmo mobile app.  “Avenir is a robust font that comes in
  many weights. It provides us with a timeless elegance and a rock solid
  foundation.”

* Arial is recommended (by the Cozmo style guide) when is Avenir isn’t
  available.  [You can compare here](http://www.identifont.com/differences?first=arial&second=avenir&q=Go)

* Eurostile is *the* classic font used in science fiction, such as WALL-E, the
  Incredibles, and so on.  It is more square than Avenir.

* Anki had their own graphic font, which is clean, sans serif.  Not sure where
  a TTF or OTF can be found

* Univers is the typeface Anki style guide recommends to use if the "Anki
  typeface" isn’t available.  It is very similar to Avenir.  Avenir has a few
  more flourishes.

* TT Norms. The Vector style guide says to that the tagline "The Robot to Life
  With" is set in the font TT Norms.   This is also very similar to Avenir.
