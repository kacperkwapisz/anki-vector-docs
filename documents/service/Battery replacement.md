* A bigger battery: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32956226523.html

Note: neither of these is a the same "toy safe" kind as the original, and so

Desolder the batteryâ€™s positive lead first.
Then wrap the end of the lead in electrical tape to insulate it -- to help prevent it from touching sensitive electronics.
